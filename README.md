# Why am I starting this serie??

Data Science is a field full of surprises 🎉 — from beautiful models to mysterious paradoxes. As I’ve a modest experience ☺️ in real-world projects, I’ve come across some discoveries and practical insights that weren’t in articles and tutorials — but made a difference in my case.  
  
That’s why I’m starting this series:  
Whether you’re a student trying to discover the world of data, a practitioner debugging a messy model, or just someone who loves this field — this series is for you.  
  
👀 What you should expect??  
- Quick tips that save time (and headaches)
- Common pitfalls with real examples
- Intuition behind techniques
- Some detours into fun paradoxes and visual tricks
  
I also welcome your experience! If a trick worked for you, or if you have a clever solution others might benefit from, feel free to jump in and share it.  
  
Happy Reading 💡!
